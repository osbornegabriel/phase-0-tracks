	<h2>Panflute Warriors in the Modern World</h2>
	<p>Panflute Warriors were long thought to have disappeared until the ground-breaking investigative report published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat">Jean-Paul Marat</a> in 1776. He revealed panflute warriors now walked the earth as monks, dueling each other to the death in order to maintain their fighting prowess for when the darkness returns.</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Panflute Warriors exist within all cultures throughout the world.</li>
		<li>Panflute Warriors used to slay gods and demons with the majesty of their melodies. Now, they slay each other.</li>
