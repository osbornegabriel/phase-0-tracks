1) Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
***Command:
  SELECT * FROM food_groups;
*** Output:
1|chicken|Anything dish involving poultry and/or fish|Chicken, Fried Chicken, Salmon, Stir-fry - unless beef or pork, fish sticks, wings
2|hamburger|anything and everything beef, plus non-chicken sandwiches|Burgers, Steak, Reubens Meatballs, BBQ Sauce
3|pizza|Anything pizza or Italian related|Pizza, lasagna, The Pope, cappucinos, coffee, arguably pienapple if you're into that kind of thing
4|ice cream|Anything delicious, sweet, or dairy|Ice Cream, Snow, MilkShakes, Cookies, also coffee, Chocolate, Strawberries


2) Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
***Command:
UPDATE food
...> SET food_group_id=3
...> WHERE food_id = 4;
*** Output: N/A


3) Display the information in both tables using one query.
***Command: SELECT * FROM food JOIN food_groups ON food_group_id = food_groups.id;
*** Output:
1|Bloody Steak|true|2|2|hamburger|anything and everything beef, plus non-chicken sandwiches|Burgers, Steak, Reubens Meatballs, BBQ Sauce
2|Cheesecake|true|4|4|ice cream|Anything delicious, sweet, or dairy|Ice Cream, Snow, MilkShakes, Cookies, also coffee, Chocolate, Strawberries
3|Pickles|false|2|2|hamburger|anything and everything beef, plus non-chicken sandwiches|Burgers, Steak, Reubens Meatballs, BBQ Sauce
4|Bacon|true|3|3|pizza|Anything pizza or Italian related|Pizza, lasagna, The Pope, cappucinos, coffee, arguably pienapple if you're into that kind of thing


4) Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
***Command: SELECT food.name, food_group_id, food_groups.name FROM food JOIN food_groups ON food_group_id = food_groups.id;
*** Output:
Bloody Steak|2|hamburger
Cheesecake|4|ice cream
Pickles|2|hamburger
Bacon|3|pizza


5) Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
***Command: DELETE FROM food
   ...> WHERE delicious="false";
*** Output: N/A

---------------------

1) There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?

A great link/explainer on JOINs: http://www.dofactory.com/sql/join

2) Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

***Command: SELECT food.name, delicious, food_groups.name
   ...> FROM food JOIN food_groups
   ...> ON food.food_group_id = food_groups.id;
***Output:
    Bloody Steak|true|hamburger
    Cheesecake|true|ice cream
    Bacon|true|pizza

***Command: SELECT food.name, delicious, food_groups.name
   ...> FROM food JOIN food_groups
   ...> ON food.food_group_id = food_groups.id
   ...> WHERE food_group_id = 2;
***Output:
    Bloody Steak|true|hamburger

***Command:  SELECT * FROM food, food_groups
   ...> WHERE food_group_id = food_groups.id;
***Output:
    1|Bloody Steak|true|2|2|hamburger|anything and everything beef, plus non-chicken sandwiches|Burgers, Steak, Reubens Meatballs, BBQ Sauce
    2|Cheesecake|true|4|4|ice cream|Anything delicious, sweet, or dairy|Ice Cream, Snow, MilkShakes, Cookies, also coffee, Chocolate, Strawberries
    4|Bacon|true|3|3|pizza|Anything pizza or Italian related|Pizza, lasagna, The Pope, cappucinos, coffee, arguably pienapple if you're into that kind of thing
