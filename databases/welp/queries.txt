1.You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

***command: SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users On reviews.user_id = users.id;
  
****output: 1|5|Perfect place to get married|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Holly|Berry
2|2|After 6 kids and many years together we are now divorced.... Not the best memories!|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
3|5|The food is delicious but can't comment on the decor...|2|4|2|G-Borne's House of Soul|4|Steven|Wonder

2.There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

****command: SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users On reviews.user_id = users.id;

****output: Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Holly|Berry|Perfect place to get married
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|After 6 kids and many years together we are now divorced.... Not the best memories!

3.How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

****command: SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users On reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE reviews.id = 1;

****Output: Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Holly|Berry|Perfect place to get married
