# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to save the evolving steps of a working project. This allows you to revert to earlier versions of a project should something go awry, as well as save files should any be lost.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an off-shoot (soon modified) version of the master code. This allows you to tinker with the code without changing the currently implemented version. Doing so enables you and others to review the new code before merging it into the master branch, thus minimizing bugs.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save state of the current code in a branch. A good commit message clearly describes any newly added features and changes to the previously existing code, since the previous commit has taken place.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you're faced with disagreeing changes during a branch merge. This typically occurs when the existing branch has diverged since you're initial cloning, thereby creating conflict with the branch you're attempting to merge. To resolve, you will have to decide what the end result for the code should be.
