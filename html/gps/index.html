<!--
1) Html5 semantic tags provides better mental visualization for the overall structure and flow of the page when one is only viewing the code. Of these tags, <nav> seems like one that would appear in every webpage. Similarly, both <header> and <footer> seem functionally useful for any page regardless of content.
2) Elements will be displayed in the order they are written in the html doc. Semantic elements function the same way as <div>, but provide better clarity for someone examining the code.
3) I did not know about creating sublime snippets prior to this assignment. If I begin to regularly build pages, I'll create more snippets that follow a customization of how I like to structure my websites on a general level inside the <body> section.
4) I don't yet know why we would use "UTF-8" for our charset value. What other charset can be used, and why do we choose the different options?? Sounds like a good personal research project for google and stackoverflow!
