jquery sources:

Things jquery can do according to the challenge:
  -Add event listeners for clicking, hovering, and other user actions
  -Add or remove CSS classes in response to events
  -Make elements fade in or out, slide up or down, or otherwise transition from visible to invisible
  -Grab values from forms
  ... and lots more!

1) Look up what jquery sources are available, to see what's most effective
-- Also look at videos potentially?
-- There's likely a user manual, similar to the one for ruby, look that up
-- Read some articles on w3
-- Perhaps even google "best jquery faqs/resources/tutorials"

2) On breaks
-- It's late, so perhaps five minute tea breaks every 20-30 min
-- Eat some food after the first thirty minute chunk or after the first hour, just to have energy for the rest of this long night

3) When to test
-- First, you need to get a general grasp on what the jquery even is
-- After the meal break, start messing around with various bits of code
