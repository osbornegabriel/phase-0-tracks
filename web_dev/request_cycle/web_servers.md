1) What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

    The Linux philosophy is based around the idea that the user actually knows what they're doing. There's a great quote I encountered about Linux/Unix, attributed to Doug Gwyn:
      "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things."
    On a more specific perspective, here is the 9 major tenets of the Linux philosophy:

      -Small is Beautiful
      -Each Program Does One Thing Well
      -Prototype as Soon as Possible
      -Choose Portability Over Efficiency
      -Store Data in Flat Text Files
      -Use Software Leverage
      -Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
      -Avoid Captive User Interfaces
      -Make Every Program a Filter

      Linux is a hacker designed system, and strongly follows an open-source philosophy.

2) In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?



Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
